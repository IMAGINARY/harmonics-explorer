## Harmonic Series Explorer

This is a little Angular 2 application that can be used to explore the [harmonic series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music)) of sine waves. You have a number of harmonics (sine waves with frequencies
that are integer multiples of the base frequency) that you can control individually, and then listen to the result.

[See demo](http://teropa.info/harmonics-explorer/)

This also serves as an example codebase of the following tech stack:

* Angular 2
* @ngrx/store with hot loading
* @ngrx/effects
* Immutable.js
* Angular Material 2
* Web Audio
* Canvas graphics

I've added various comments to the code so if you want to see how the project works, I hope you'll find everything you need.
